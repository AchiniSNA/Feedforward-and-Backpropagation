# Project Description

This project builds a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model from scratch to perform binary classification on images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model classify images of two specific digits (e.g., "1" and "5") by predicting whether an input image belongs to one of two classes.

## Dataset

- **MNIST**: Contains 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9).
- **Preprocessing**: Only two digits are selected for binary classification.
